# Vending Machine
## Just Launched My First Coding Project! 

I'm thrilled to share my debut coding project with you all – a simple terminal-based vending machine programmed in C! 

In this project, I've harnessed the power of C to create a functional vending machine that uses if-else statements, for loops, and file handling. It might not have a flashy UI, but it's a testament to the core principles of programming.
